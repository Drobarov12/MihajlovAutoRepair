# React wirh Matirial UI

## Project structure
```bash
- public
    assets
- src
    components
    context
    locales
    pages
    services
    index.js
    theme.js
```

The project is organized into several key directories and files that contribute to the overall functionality of the app:

#### **src**  
The main directory of the project, containing the core code for the application. The entry point of the app is located in the **index.js** file, which is responsible for rendering the root component and initializing the app.

#### **pages**  
This folder contains all the pages in the app. The pages are organized in separate folders for grouped pages, with simpler pages located directly within the root of this directory.

#### **components**  
The **components** directory holds the reusable UI elements and components that help streamline the user experience. These components are designed to be used across various parts of the app, promoting consistency and reducing redundancy.

#### **services**  
The **services** directory is where external communication services are managed. Currently, the main service is the **api** service, which acts as the bridge for communication between the React application and the backend API.

---

### 2. **Core Features**

- **HomePage**: This is a single-page component that assembles multiple smaller components to create the main view of the app.
- **Reusability**: Components in the **components** folder are intended to be reused throughout the app to maintain a smooth and consistent user experience.
- **API Integration**: The **services/api** service handles the interaction between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth communication for data fetching and updates.

##  Creating a Reusable Confirmation Popup in React Using Material-UI

### Overview

In modern web applications, it’s common to prompt users with confirmation dialogs before performing critical actions, such as deleting items, submitting irreversible forms, or confirming significant state changes. This ensures that users have the opportunity to verify their intentions before triggering an action. React, combined with Material-UI, provides a simple and powerful way to create reusable and consistent UI elements such as confirmation dialogs. This documentation explains how to create a reusable confirmation popup in a React app using Material-UI components, manage its state globally with React Context, and integrate it across various parts of your application.

### Why You Need a Reusable Confirmation Dialog

A confirmation dialog is an essential UI component that improves both the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) consistency. Here are some reasons why it’s beneficial to implement a reusable confirmation dialog in your application:

#### 1. **Consistency Across the Application**
   - A confirmation dialog should behave consistently across the entire app. Users should see the same design, feel, and functionality whether they are confirming the deletion of a record, logging out of the app, or accepting an important action. By creating a reusable confirmation dialog component, you ensure that the dialog behaves the same way in every instance, making your app more cohesive and user-friendly.

#### 2. **Better User Experience**
   - Without confirmation dialogs, users might accidentally perform destructive or irreversible actions, such as deleting important data or submitting a form incorrectly. A confirmation dialog asks for user validation before proceeding with such actions, reducing the likelihood of mistakes and increasing the overall confidence users have in interacting with your app.

#### 3. **Centralized Logic**
   - By creating a reusable confirmation dialog and managing its state globally, you avoid code duplication. This reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs due to inconsistencies or missed logic when implementing the confirmation dialogs manually on each page. Centralizing this logic also makes the code easier to maintain and modify. For example, if you need to update the look or behavior of your confirmation dialog, you only have to do it in one place.

#### 4. **Improved Code Readability and Maintainability**
   - Reusing the confirmation dialog across pages and components simplifies your codebase. Instead of writing separate modal implementations on different pages, you centralize the dialog in one component and a React Context. This approach is much cleaner and easier to debug or extend.

#### 5. **Scalability**
   - As your application grows and more pages or features are added, maintaining multiple versions of confirmation dialogs can become cumbersome. A global solution ensures that the confirmation logic scales without becoming fragmented or difficult to manage.

---

### Step-by-Step Explanation

Let’s break down how we create a reusable confirmation dialog in React and integrate it across the app.

#### Step 2: Create the Confirmation Dialog Component

We begin by creating a simple confirmation dialog component that will accept props like `open` (whether the dialog is visible), `title` (the title of the dialog), `message` (the message to be displayed), and two functions: `onClose` (to handle closing the dialog) and `onConfirm` (to handle the action when the user confirms).

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Dialog, DialogActions, DialogContent, DialogTitle, Button } from '@mui/material';

const ConfirmationDialog = ({ open, onClose, onConfirm, title, message }) => {
  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onClose={() => onClose(false)}>
      <DialogTitle>{title}</DialogTitle>
      <DialogContent>{message}</DialogContent>
      <DialogActions>
        <Button onClick={() => onClose(false)} color="primary">
          Cancel
        </Button>
        <Button onClick={() => { onConfirm(); onClose(false); }} color="primary">
          Confirm
        </Button>
      </DialogActions>
    </Dialog>
  );
};

export default ConfirmationDialog;
```

**Explanation of Components:**
- `Dialog`: This is the container for the confirmation dialog, displaying the modal overlay.
- `DialogTitle`: The title of the dialog (e.g., "Delete Item").
- `DialogContent`: The body of the dialog, which contains the message (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this item?").
- `DialogActions`: Contains the buttons for the user to either cancel or confirm the action.

This dialog component is simple but flexible enough to be reused anywhere in the app.

---

#### Step 3: Create a Context to Manage the Confirmation Dialog State

Instead of managing the state of the confirmation dialog locally within each page or component, we use React Context to provide a global state management solution. This allows us to trigger the dialog from any part of the application.

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';
import ConfirmationDialog from '../components/ConfirmationDialog';

const ConfirmationDialogContext = createContext();

export const useConfirmationDialog = () => {
  return useContext(ConfirmationDialogContext);
};

export const ConfirmationDialogProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  const [title, setTitle] = useState('');
  const [onConfirm, setOnConfirm] = useState(() => () => {});

  const handleClose = () => setOpen(false);
  const handleConfirm = () => {
    onConfirm();
    handleClose();
  };

  const showConfirmationDialog = (title, message, onConfirm) => {
    setTitle(title);
    setMessage(message);
    setOnConfirm(() => onConfirm);
    setOpen(true);
  };

  return (
    <ConfirmationDialogContext.Provider value={{ showConfirmationDialog }}>
      {children}
      <ConfirmationDialog
        open={open}
        onClose={handleClose}
        onConfirm={handleConfirm}
        title={title}
        message={message}
      />
    </ConfirmationDialogContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

**Explanation of Key Concepts:**
- **React Context (`ConfirmationDialogContext`)**: This context stores and provides access to the function `showConfirmationDialog`, which can trigger the dialog from anywhere in the app.
- **State Management**: We store the dialog’s state (`open`, `message`, `title`, `onConfirm`) inside the context. The `showConfirmationDialog` function is responsible for setting these values, which will trigger the display of the dialog.
- **Global State**: By using context, the confirmation dialog is made globally available, so it can be accessed and triggered from any part of the app.

---

#### Step 4: Wrap the Application with the Context Provider

To make the confirmation dialog accessible from any page or component in your app, wrap your entire application (or a part of it) with the `ConfirmationDialogProvider` component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ConfirmationDialogProvider } from './context/ConfirmationDialogContext';
import HomePage from './pages/HomePage';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ConfirmationDialogProvider>
      <HomePage />
      <LoginPage />
      ...
    </ConfirmationDialogProvider>
  )
}
```

And in the pages you can simply import it and call the method `showConfirmationDialog` it will show the dialog

```jsx
import { useConfirmationDialog } from '../../contexts/ConfirmationDialogContext';

const HomePage = () => {
  const { showConfirmationDialog } = useConfirmationDialog();


  const openDialog = () => {
    showConfirmationDialog(
      'Hello', 
      'You clicked the button on home page',
      () => consloe.log('Confirm the click'))
  }

  return(
    <Box>
      <Button onClick={() => openDialog()}> Click me </Button>
    </Box>
  );

};
```

This is a short example on how to use the dialog in one page, we can allways costomise the `showConfirmationDialog` methot to add more custom things to our dialog.

## What is i18next and why I use it

i18next is an framework for JavaScript that provides tools for handling translations and localization in applications. It allows you to manage multiple languages, switch between them, and handle various localization features like pluralization, formatting, and more. It's widely used in React apps to create multilingual applications. Good sites to use i18next in a React app include apps that target multiple language regions or those offering content in different languages, such as e-commerce platforms, blogs, and global service platforms, where users from diverse linguistic backgrounds need to interact with the app in their preferred language.

### **Explanation of the set up**

#### **1. Initialization of i18next**

```javascript
import i18n from 'i18next';
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
```
- `i18next`: This is the core library for internationalization. It manages language resources, and translation keys, and handles language switching.
- `initReactI18next`: This is a plugin that integrates `i18next` with React. It allows React components to use the translation features provided by `i18next`.

#### **2. Loading Translation Resources**

```javascript
import translationEN from './locales/en/translation.json';
import translationMK from './locales/mk/translation.json';

const resources = {
  en: {
    translation: translationEN,
  },
  mk: {
    translation: translationMK,
  },
};
```
- Translation files (`translationEN.json` and `translationMK.json`) contain the actual translations for each language.
  - For example, the file `translationEN.json` might look like:
    ```json
    {
      "welcome": "Welcome to our app!"
    }
    ```
  - Similarly, `translationMK.json` might look like:
    ```json
    {
      "welcome": "Добредојдовте во нашата апликација!"
    }
    ```
- The `resources` object organizes these translations by language code (e.g., `en` for English, `mk` for Macedonian). Each language has a `translation` key, which points to the respective JSON file.

#### **3. i18next Configuration**

```javascript
i18n
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    resources,
    lng: 'mk',  // Default language
    fallbackLng: 'mk'  // Fallback language if the selected language is unavailable
  });
```

- `.use(initReactI18next)`: This integrates `i18next` with React, enabling React components to use translations.
- `.init()`: This initializes the `i18next` instance with:
  - `resources`: Contains the translation files.
  - `lng`: The default language set for the app (in this case, Macedonian `mk`).
  - `fallbackLng`: The language to fallback to if a translation is missing in the selected language (here, it also defaults to Macedonian).

#### **4. Exporting i18n**

```javascript
export default i18n;
```
This makes the `i18n` instance available for use in other parts of the application.

---

### **Using Translations in Components**

In your components, you use the `useTranslation` hook to access the translation function (`t`), which allows you to get the translated string for a given key.

```javascript
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useTranslation();

  return <h1>{t('welcome')}</h1>; // Translates the 'welcome' key
};
```

- The `t('welcome')` will return the translation based on the current language. For example, if the language is set to `mk`, it will return `"Добредојдовте во нашата апликација!"`, and if it's set to `en`, it will return `"Welcome to our app!"`.

---

### **Why This Is Good for my Project**

1. **Multi-Language Support**: This setup allows my app to easily support multiple languages, enabling a broader audience by catering to people from different regions or language preferences.

2. **Scalability**: As your project grows and I need to add more languages, I can simply add new translation files (e.g., `translationES.json` for Spanish), and extend the `resources` object.

3. **Centralized Translations**: With the translation keys and values centralized in JSON files, it’s easier to manage and update translations without having to modify the application logic or UI components directly.

4. **Dynamic Language Switching**: The `i18next` library provides the ability to switch languages at runtime, which is useful for users who want to change the language of the app dynamically without reloading the page.

5. **Fallback Mechanism**: The `fallbackLng` configuration ensures that if a translation is missing for a specific key in the selected language, the app will fallback to the default language, avoiding broken UI or untranslated text.

---

### **Potential Drawbacks or Considerations**

1. **Initial Load Performance**: Loading translation files might slightly delay the initial render of your app, especially if the translation files are large. However, this can be mitigated by lazy-loading translation files when needed or using a CDN for static assets.

2. **Managing Translation Keys**: As the project grows, managing translation keys can become cumbersome, especially if they are scattered across many files. It's important to keep the keys organized and avoid duplication or inconsistencies. Tools like **i18next-parser** can help automate the extraction and maintenance of keys.

3. **SEO and Accessibility**: For apps with server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG), you'll need to ensure that the language is properly reflected in the HTML for SEO and accessibility purposes. i18next supports this, but it requires additional configuration for SSR (e.g., with Next.js or Gatsby).

4. **Complexity for Small Projects**: If your app is simple and doesn't require localization for multiple languages, this approach might add unnecessary complexity. For small projects, simple solutions like hard-coding text or using `react-intl` for just a few strings might be enough.

---

### **Conclusion**

Using `i18next` and `react-i18next` for managing translations in your React app is a robust and scalable approach. It’s beneficial for projects that require multi-language support or may need to scale internationally. It allows you to maintain clean, localized code, easily add new languages, and improve accessibility for a global audience. However, for smaller projects with limited localization needs, it may introduce unnecessary complexity.

### **Explanation of Tables for admin users**

In this example I'm  using a **Material-UI (MUI) Table** in React to manage and display reservation data. Let’s break down how the table works in this context and the benefits of using it in my project.

### **How the Table Works in My Code**

1. **Table Structure (Head and Body)**:
   - The `Table` component in MUI is composed of multiple child components, such as `TableHead`, `TableBody`, `TableRow`, and `TableCell`, which define the structure of the table.
   - The table is split into two main sections:
     - `TableHead`: Defines the headers for each column, such as Name, Phone Number, Model, Description, Type, DateTime, and Actions.
     - `TableBody`: Holds the actual data rows. Each `TableRow` represents a reservation, and each `TableCell` within that row displays a specific attribute (e.g., the reservation's user name, phone number, model, etc.).

2. **Dynamic Data Population**:
   - The `filteredReservations` array is mapped to create `TableRow` components for each reservation. This array is filtered based on the search query (`handleFilterChange`), which allows users to search and filter the table.
   - For each row, you are checking whether the row is being edited (`editingRow`) or not, and rendering either the editable fields or the display-only values.
   
3. **Edit and Delete Actions**:
   - The "Edit" button (`IconButton` with `EditIcon`) triggers the `handleEdit` function, which sets the row to be in editing mode, allowing the user to update data.
   - The "Delete" button (`IconButton` with `DeleteIcon`) triggers the `handleDelete` function, which removes the reservation from the state (and the backend) after confirmation.

4. **Saving and Clearing Edits**:
   - When the user finishes editing, they can click the "Save" button (`IconButton` with `SaveIcon`) to save the changes. The `handleSave` function updates the reservation in the state and the backend.
   - The "Clear" button (`IconButton` with `ClearIcon`) resets the form to its original state when the user cancels the editing.

5. **Dropdown and Autocomplete Components**:
   - The `Autocomplete` component is used to display models, providing the user with a search-as-you-type experience for model names.
   - The `Select` component is used to select a reservation's type, showing a list of available types from the `types` array.

---

### **Benefits of Using Tables in My Project**

#### **1. Structured Data Display**

Tables are an effective way to display structured, tabular data like reservations, where each row represents an individual entry and each column represents a specific attribute (e.g., name, phone number, type). The tabular format allows users to easily compare values across different entries.

In my example:
- Each reservation is represented as a row.
- Each column (name, phone number, model, etc.) represents a property of the reservation.

This makes the data much more readable and easier to understand, especially when dealing with complex datasets.

#### **2. Editable Rows**

The ability to edit a row dynamically within the table is a key feature. By switching between display mode and edit mode for each row, users can interactively modify data without navigating away from the table.

- **When a row is being edited**, users can input changes (e.g., phone number, model, description).
- **After saving**, the updated data is displayed, keeping the user in the context of the table.

This eliminates the need for multiple forms or separate pages to edit individual records.

#### **3. Data Filtering and Searching**

The search feature that allows users to filter reservations based on any of the row's values. The search functionality works by comparing the query against each reservation’s values and updating the state to show only the matching results.

- **Filtering** allows users to quickly narrow down results based on a keyword (e.g., a specific model name or user phone number).
- This is especially useful in tables with large datasets, as it helps users find specific data without manually scrolling through large amounts of information.

#### **4. Data Deletion with Confirmation**

The table also includes the ability to delete data (reservations) with a confirmation dialog. This ensures that users don’t accidentally delete important data, improving the user experience and providing a safety net before performing a potentially destructive action.

- **Confirmation dialog** ensures that the user consciously chooses to delete a reservation.
- After deletion, the table updates dynamically to reflect the change, giving immediate feedback to the user.

#### **5. Responsive Design and Accessibility**

The MUI table is responsive, and it allows for easy customization of styling and behavior (e.g., sticky headers, filtering, and dynamic row heights). We can also add features such as pagination, sorting, and more.

- **Sticky headers** (`stickyHeader` prop on the `Table` component) ensure that column names are always visible while scrolling, improving usability.
- **Responsive behavior** ensures that the table adapts to different screen sizes, making it user-friendly on mobile and desktop devices.

#### **6. Integration with Backend Services**

The table data in my example is being fetched from the backend using functions like `fetchReservations`, `fetchModels`, and `fetchTypes`. The ability to asynchronously load data into the table makes it scalable for large datasets and dynamic content.

- **Fetching data asynchronously** means that the table can display real-time data or data that is continually updated on the backend.
- This is crucial for admin dashboards or reservation systems where the data changes frequently (e.g., new reservations are added or existing reservations are updated).

#### **7. Modularity and Reusability**

The table setup is modular, and each part (e.g., the rows, cells, or even actions like edit and delete) can be reused across different components in my application. We can create similar tables for other entities (e.g., users, products, etc.) by simply passing different data and actions.

This keeps the codebase DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), and helps you maintain consistent behavior and appearance across different parts of the app.

#### **8. Customization**

Using MUI’s components provides flexibility for customization, such as:
- Custom styling (colors, backgrounds, borders).
- Custom rendering of cells (e.g., showing dates in a specific format or displaying custom icons for actions).
- Using other MUI components like `TextField`, `Autocomplete`, `Select`, etc., in conjunction with the table allows for rich, interactive UIs.

---

### **Conclusion**

Tables are an essential component when you need to display, manage, and interact with structured data. They provide several benefits, including structured presentation, easy editing, searchability, and data manipulation. In your project, the use of tables with dynamic rows, filters, and confirmation dialogs enhances the user experience while making the data management process efficient and streamlined.
